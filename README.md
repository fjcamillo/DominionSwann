(UI only no functionality)

On our subject Methods of Research, we were given the task to create a sample project based from the DominionSwan Decision Making Problem

In this project, I used PyQT to create a Native App, on which the user could navigate through and now what decisions to make using the knowledge or data given to the app. Everything is still UI with some navigation functionality like tabs and buttons.
